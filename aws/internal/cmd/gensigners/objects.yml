          WithCache specifies the cache storage for frequently used items.
          Currently only the public key is cached.
          
          If it is not specified, nothing will be cached.
          
          Since it would be rather easy for the key in AWS KMS and the cache
          to be out of sync, make sure to either purge the cache periodically
          or use a cache with some sort of auto-eviction mechanism.
